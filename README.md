### Tic Tac Toe

This project uses the `module pattern`. I recently learnt about it and decided to make this simple project using it. [The module pattern](https://dev.to/tomekbuszewski/module-pattern-in-javascript-56jm) allows us to use and create encapsulation in our code like if we were using a language like Java. Note that this module pattern is different from the modules introduced by ES6.


##### Design
I have been experimenting with achromatic designs a lot lately so this is another black and white design. It's mobile responsive and uses a flex column for mobile which changes to a CSS Grid for viewports greater than 750px

### Tic Tac Toe

This project uses the `module pattern`. I recently learnt about it and decided to make this simple project to practise it. [The module pattern](https://dev.to/tomekbuszewski/module-pattern-in-javascript-56jm) allows us to use and create encapsulation in our code like if we were using a language like Java. Since JavaScript doesn't have private and public variables, I will be prefixing underscores to differentiate the public objects that my modules expose from those that behave like private variables. Note that this module pattern is different from the modules introduced by ES6.
